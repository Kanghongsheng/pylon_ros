# pylon_ros
interface for basler camera based on ros
# Advantage 
This code best advantage is based on the pylon6.1.1 rather than pylon5, If you installed the pylon5 driver, You cannot run the this code
however, until now ,other code is based on pylon5, if you installed pylon6, you can not run the code which developer wrote, but my code can run with pylon6

this code source author is not mine, 
I just copy from the my lab to convience for someone who want to quickly make the camera can run based on ros, 
Please forgive me and contact with me and show your evidence if I invoke your rights.
I would delete it as soom as possible.
